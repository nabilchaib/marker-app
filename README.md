The following instructions are for running the app locally in the development environment.
In the project directory, you will need to add a `.env.development` file under `./environments/development/``. Please ask a fellow developer for that file if you don't have it.

Once you've added this file, you will be able to run `npm run env-development`. This command will also let you know if you have everything necessary installed on your computer to run this app.

Next, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Finally, you can run run the app with `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
